### Abstract

This chapter examines how the idea of a special republican mission to civilize the “primitive” people of the earth provided the ideological framework for France's colonial empire in the modern era. While its antecedents stretched back to the Enlightenment and Revolution, this claim reached its apogee under the secular Third Republic, as it embarked upon its greatest attempt ever to sell the idea of the *mission civilisatrice* to the larger French public. In the aftermath of Vichy's humiliating collaboration with Germany, the Fourth Republic reinvented the terms of imperial governance, and with it the notion of France's imperial mission to civilize. As for de Gaulle's Fifth Republic, it remains an open question whether or not the “civilizing mission” has survived the formal end of the French empire. The term has dropped out of official circulation, but its binary structures of thinking remain.

The idea of a special republican mission to civilize the “primitive” people of the earth provided the ideological framework for France’s colonial empire in the modern era. While its antecedents stretched back to the Enlightenment and Revolution, this claim reached its apogee under the secular Third Republic, when French colonization of parts of Southeast Asia; North, West, and Equatorial Africa; and Oceania began in earnest. Republican civilizing discourse in the age of empire was always shifting and unstable; certain recurrent themes nevertheless structured what officials meant by “civilization” and its opposite, “barbarism.” When fears of national decline set in during the 1920s, the Third Republic embarked upon its greatest attempt ever to sell the idea of the *mission civilisatrice* to the larger French public. In the aftermath of Vichy’s humiliating collaboration with Germany, the Fourth Republic reinvented the terms of imperial governance, and with it the notion of France’s imperial mission to civilize. As for de Gaulle’s Fifth Republic, it remains an open question whether or not the “civilizing mission” has survived the formal end of the French empire. The term has dropped out of official circulation, but its binary structures of thinking remain.

deeply engrained in a republican culture once again confronted with negotiating postcolonial difference—this time within the Hexagon.

For a long time, historians ignored the role of civilizing rhetoric in modern French imperialism. The *mission civilisatrice* obviously rang hollow to scholars living through decolonization and after, who saw in the wreckage of empire only aggressive European conquest and exploitation of less technologically advanced societies. More recently, a new appreciation of the power of language and images to produce and perpetuate inequalities between colonizer and colonized has led historians to take France’s modern civilizing mission more seriously, and to analyze it from a variety of theoretical perspectives and in multiple contexts. World’s fairs, national symbols and commemorations, the military, domesticity and the home, government circulars, law courts, legal codes, school textbooks, imperial propaganda, the new social sciences, marriage and paternity debates, missionary societies, health manuals—and the list goes on—are seen as so many sites for the constant reinvention and assertion of notions of French civilization and the colonial need for it. Such notions were critical to maintaining white privilege in a republican regime officially committed to the unity and equality of humankind.

The notion of a secular civilizing mission is a particularly French one; the French invented the very word “civilization” in the eighteenth century, and have celebrated the achievements of their own ever since. But the idea acquired a noticeably stronger resonance after the return of democratic institutions in 1870, as the new Third Republic struggled to reconcile its ambitious new imperialism with its universalistic ideals. The republican civilizing mission rested upon certain contradictory assumptions about the superiority of French culture and the universal perfectibility of humankind. It implied that France’s colonial subjects were too primitive to rule themselves but capable of being uplifted. It intimated that French men and women (in different ways) were particularly suited, by virtue of their revolutionary heritage and their current industrial strength, to carry out the task of liberating all of humanity—beginning with the peoples they were colonizing. Last but not least, it assumed that republicans in particular had a duty and a right to remake conquered peoples along lines inspired by the recent cultural, political, and economic development of France.

Underlying these general convictions, one principle more than any other dominated republican ideology of civilization from the 1870s onward: mastery—mastery of nature, including one’s own body, and mastery of what can be called social behavior. To be civilized was to be free of specific forms of tyranny: those of the elements over humankind, of disease over health, of instinct over reason, of ignorance over knowledge, of men over women, and perhaps most importantly, of despotism over liberty. Mastery in all of these realms was integral to the identity that the leaders of the Third Republic sought to forge for the French nation after 1870. It was because French science and technology had triumphed over geography, climate, and disease to create new internal and external markets, and because France’s leaders, before those of all other nations, had overcome oppression and superstition to form a democratic and rational government of equal male citizens, that republican France deemed itself so civilized. By the same token, it was because the inhabitants of the non-European world were perceived to have failed on these same fronts—because they appeared to lack the crucial ability to achieve mastery—that they were obviously barbarians in need of the universal civilization first developed in the modern era by republicans in France.

If a conflation of civilization with mastery was a defining and permanent characteristic of republican imperialist rhetoric, the specific content of the *mission civilisatrice* nevertheless shifted depending on particular colonial situations and changing political and economic trends in France. From the early years of the Third Republic until World War I, when republican zeal reached its zenith, several tenets dominated civilization doctrine. First, the new governing elite believed that civilization required that they improve their subjects’ standard of living through the rational development, or what republicans called the *mise en valeur*, of the colonies’ natural and human resources. This objective, they thought, could best be achieved by building railroads—because railroads would link interiors to the coast and promote the exchange of

peoples, currencies, commodities, and ideas—and by improving hygiene to eliminate the endemic diseases deadly to the colonizer and colonized alike. Second, and contrary to the myth that France wished to assimilate the colonized culturally by making them fully French, the republicans in power insisted that the different African, Asian, and Oceanic peoples had to evolve within their own cultures. The only exception was when aspects of these cultures conflicted with the republican principles of French civilization. In these instances, the offending institutions or traditions were to be suppressed and replaced by French ones. The targets of eradication varied from colony to colony: in sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania—considered the most backward territories—indigenous languages, “barbaric” customs, slavery, and “feudal” chieftaincies were loudly proclaimed incompatible with progress; in Indochina and North Africa the emphasis fell more on “regenerating” the decadent political, social, and religious institutions in place when the French arrived. Everywhere, however, the universal virtues of the French language, modern social relations, and enlightened justice were expected to triumph.

When liberal values lost favor in France after World War I, this definition of the civilizing mission began to change in subtle ways. Interwar governments dwelt less on the themes of eradicating institutions antithetical to French civilization; instead they emphasized more than ever the need to associate new and traditional colonial elites in policymaking and to preserve precolonial societies and cultures while encouraging them to change slowly from within. Politically, association meant consulting these elites in decisions regarding them—a policy already in place in the more “advanced” protectorates in Indochina, Tunisia, and Morocco, and which was now to be applied across the empire. Culturally, association stipulated respecting the exotic cultures of the empire, and incorporating them symbolically into an ethnically diverse but unified Greater France.

Also in the 1920s and 1930s, French imperial authorities rejected the formerly held opinion that railroads alone would trigger the desired increase in African standards of living. The key to tapping the economic potential of the different colonies was the *mise en valeur* of its human resources. Human *mise en valeur* meant a more intensive focus on improving the colonial producer’s health, fertility, and farming methods compared to conditions and practices in the prewar era. It also included the conviction—implicit before but now clearly articulated—that it was necessary forcibly to inculcate a work ethic in colonized peoples, which they supposedly lacked. To be civilized, according to this definition, was to exchange “laziness” for wage labor under European supervision in a capitalist system of agricultural production for export. Coerced labor would gradually yield to free labor, as the local populations internalized the lesson that wage labor alone held the key to progress and prosperity.

As this brief summary suggests, the language of the civilizing mission in France was always both republican and racist. Or to put it another way, French civilizing discourse simultaneously manufactured ideas of sameness and difference in ways that twisted and turned according to circumstances of time and place. On the one hand, contrasting concepts of “civilization” and “barbarism” encouraged the French to view Africans and Asians as different and inferior “others,” who needed a helping hand from the nation of the “rights of man”—at gunpoint if necessary. On the other hand, this same binary nevertheless held out the promise that these “others” were capable of improvement in France’s own image; in this sense the colonized were viewed as fellow humans, with the same potential capacities as the inhabitants of France. Moreover, as colonizers, the French constantly claimed to take new reforming measures on behalf of the colonized as they evolved: first the abolition of slavery, then the eradication of ignorance, disease, and sloth. In due course forced labor, too, would be phased out, as further proof of French generosity; and after 1944 a diluted form of citizenship for all colonial subjects was introduced. Thanks to the endless recycling and recalibrating of these civilizing claims, which humanized colonial peoples and naturalized their inferiority in equal measure, republicans of good faith could more easily accept the perversion of democracy that their colonialism always represented.

As a concept structured around malleable notions of similarity and difference, republican civilization discourse incorporated gender and class assumptions as well as those of race. In France, the qualities of reason and rationality deemed necessary to democratic governance were understood to be the exclusive possession of men. Women, tied as they ostensibly were to the particularity of their sex, fell short of the abstract status of the individual necessary for full citizenship. Yet the same feminine qualities that dictated French women’s exclusion from the vote made them ideal helpmeets in the republican civilizing project, in the metropole and overseas. Leading male politicians—and indeed many female reformers—insisted that due to their “natural” generosity of spirit and roles as mères au foyer, bourgeois women were particularly suited for bettering the lower classes and the lower “races” culturally and morally. Female social workers could penetrate within working-class families and instruct poor women how to fight the social diseases of alcoholism, tuberculosis, and infant mortality—thereby promoting class reconciliation and civilization. What was true in the slums of French cities was even truer in colonies like Algeria and Tunisia, where colonialists believed that Muslim men confined local women to harems, imprisoned them in the veil, and refused to educate them. White women alone could hope to enter these private and mysterious domestic spaces, uplift their Muslim sisters, and build trust—or so it was imagined—across the racial or religious divide. French wives in the colonies could also perform the important task of keeping their husbands from becoming decivilized in the “sensuous” and “decadent” tropics—by maintaining proper middle-class homes that would reduce the temptation of destabilizing sexual traffic across the color line.

Historians have just begun to examine the extent to which the ideas and language of the civilizing mission affected policymaking overseas, and the picture that is emerging is both incomplete and complex. During the crusading years of the early Third Republic, the regime’s core values influenced high-level officials’ actions on the ground more than later. In West Africa, for example, the governors-general from 1895 onward issued a series of edicts ending the legal status of slavery in their territories, liberating ethnic groups from African “oppressors,” establishing courts to enforce civilized standards of justice, and requiring administrators to set up health services and build schools. Governors-general also sought to finance the port and railroad construction deemed essential—as the administration put it—to stimulating the economic development from which French and Africans alike would ostensibly benefit. They passed naturalization laws that would allow a select handful of the most “evolved” of their subjects to become citizens, and set official limits to the degree of coercion that could ever be used against the colonized. These measures convinced contemporaries that the civilizing mission was no mere window dressing designed to mask exploitation—but a guarantee of good administration for people deemed incapable of evolving on their own, and whose guardianship France had generously accepted.

Despite its close association with republican ideology and governance, France’s civilizing mission was not an exclusively republican idea in the period between 1870 and 1914. Nor do ideas inherited from 1789 alone explain the timing and content of many of the civilizing measures adopted overseas. The Third Republic was in fact home to two competing missions: the secular one of its new governing elite, and a religious one espoused by the regime’s greatest enemy, at least until World War I—the Catholic Church, which insisted on its own universal mission to civilize by bringing the heathen of France’s new empire to Christ. In theory, the two missions were not hostile to each other; one of the most popular dictums of the early Third Republic—uttered by none other than Gambetta himself—was that anticlericalism was “not an item for export.” Hardheaded pragmatism underlay this official decision to bury the hatchet with the church when it came to the empire. Having invoked the mission civilisatrice to help reconcile an ambivalent nation to imperialism, the leaders of the Third Republic had little interest in paying for programs to reform, educate, and improve the livelihoods of their newly acquired colonial populations—some sixty million people. After 1900 all colonies were made self-financing and thrown back on their own usually limited resources. Colonial officials, who numbered around four thousand, responded to this parsimony not by ignoring the Third Republic’s official civilizing promises, but by turning to the most convenient and inexpensive alternative

available for carrying them out: the fifty-eight thousand Catholic missionaries living abroad, most of them in the colonies.

Far from getting along together, however, missionaries and republican administrators routinely fought each other for “the hearts and minds” of their colonial subjects. Their conflicts mirrored the deep divide in late nineteenth-century France between Catholics devoted to their faith and republican anticlericals determined to cleanse the nation—and particularly its public schools—of the church’s influence. These conflicts took a number of different forms. Some administrators and colonists resented the disruptive impact conversion had on the colonial populations, since conversion could turn neighbors against one another and split whole villages into feuding clans. They argued that the church’s divisive presence prevented the colony from developing economically. In Paris, republican deputies excoriated missionaries in Indochina for teaching Latin in their schools rather than French and questioned whether any Catholic priest could be a good patriot. This bickering crescendoed in the wake of the Dreyfus affair, when the intensification of the Republic’s war against the church ricocheted in the empire. The liquidation of the affair, however, opened a genuine era of reconciliation that endured until World War I and beyond. Secular republicans and Catholic missionaries set aside their disagreements and found common civilizing goals in pursuit of which they could and did cooperate. As J. P. Daughton has argued, this deep pattern of interaction between France’s two missions between 1870 and 1914 ultimately changed both of them, confirming that the secular civilizing mission in these years was shaped as much by the encounter with Catholics as it was by the Enlightenment and revolutionary principles of the Third Republic.

If the idea of the civilizing mission structured how colonial officials approached their duties overseas, over the life of the Third Republic this same idea became more firmly entrenched in the collective minds of metropolitan French. Recent work has revealed the many ways republican officials sold the idea of the civilizing mission to a country initially ambivalent—and poorly informed—about a faraway empire that most would never see. In the 1920s and 1930s, the government attached more importance than ever to France’s colonies, seeing in them a reservoir of manpower and raw materials and a guarantor of grandeur for a depleted nation. As part of this reinvestment in empire the regime launched its first-ever mass propaganda campaign to educate public opinion about the _mission civilisatrice_. This campaign culminated in the monumental Colonial Exposition in Paris in 1931, attended by eight million French. The point of the Exposition, according to Commissioner Marcel Olivier, was to place “before the eyes of its visitors an impressive summary of the results of colonization, its present realities, its future.” It projected a vision of a Greater France, in which the metropole and colonies were united in such a way as to promote a more secure sense of national identity. The Exposition took the form of a tour, in miniature, around the empire; a separate pavilion represented each colony, and inside the pavilions native craftsmen as well as their crafts were put on display. The central attraction was a full-scale reconstruction of the Khmer temple of Angkor Wat, the original of which the French claimed they had saved from ruin. The overall image was that of a grand imperial nation-state, centralized under the selfless guidance of the French. Onlookers were supposed to leave the fairgrounds persuaded that the Africans, Indochinese, and Pacific Islanders of the French empire were on their way to becoming as “French” as the peoples of the different provinces that had historically made up the nation.

The Colonial Exposition offers one example of how representational systems such as architecture could also serve as key sites for articulating France’s mission to civilize, particularly in the 1920s and 1930s. By then, the first nationalist movements overseas were mobilizing against French rule. Leaders of these movements often belonged to a new group of French-educated elites determined to use the language of the civilizing mission to press for some form of power sharing, if not outright independence. The Third Republic, these nationalists insisted—in the impeccable French that they had mastered in schools provided by the colonizer—had conquered their homelands in the name of the universal principles of 1789. These same principles dictated the right of the colonized to a voice in their own government, if not self-rule. The Colonial

Exposition turned these claims on their head by conveying aesthetically the message that native peoples had made some progress under French tutelage, but not yet enough to warrant the rights bestowed by civilization. Each pavilion ostensibly reproduced the “authentic” culture of a particular colony, while also mixing in French stylistic elements. Togo and Cameroon, for instance, built replicas of huts from coastal Africa, enlarged, however, to the monumental proportions of buildings in Paris. Such hybridization subtly underscored how different and exotic the inhabitants of France’s overseas possessions remained—but also reminded the metropolitan viewer that French men and women together were quite literally lifting these evolutionary laggards up to new heights, which the latter could never hope to reach on their own. Compared to the early Third Republic, the superiority of French civilization over the cultures of indigenous peoples was now shown to be relative, rather than absolute—but the gap still legitimated colonization.

p. 180 The fate of the ideology of the civilizing mission after World War II—colonialism’s late period—has not been closely investigated, although studies of decolonization have suggested directions for future research. As anticolonial resistance escalated in Madagascar, Cameroon, Indochina, and North Africa, France showed no signs of preparing to leave; to the contrary, much as after World War I, it reinvested ideologically in empire while also reforming it, albeit on significantly different terms than in the 1920s. In Algeria and Vietnam, the Fourth Republic used civilizing rhetoric to justify nasty colonial wars designed to preserve these territories as part of France. And in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa—always a privileged site of civilizing claims, because colonizers considered its inhabitants the most primitive of the entire empire—the metropolitan government for the first time invested massively in the programs that had always been deemed central to the civilizing mission: education, infrastructure, and health care. French officials did so in a belated bid to win the allegiance of those seeking independence.

Yet in the wake of the Holocaust, when UNESCO officially condemned (1950) the notion that there were biological differences between the so-called races that justified their domination, the very term “civilizing mission” and its moralistic overtones became increasingly outmoded. If empires were to survive in the liberal postwar order, European hegemony would have to be justified and understood in different ways. As part of reconstruction in the 1940s and 1950s, European states increasingly emphasized production and welfare for all citizens. These metropolitan themes once again reverberated overseas, although—as in “early” and “middle” colonialism—in highly contingent ways, depending on the individual personalities involved, the local forces of accommodation and resistance that developed, and the kind of economic resources coveted. In official Fourth Republic discourse, Africans, Asians, and Oceanians were no longer cast as barbarians en route to civilization, but rather as members of backward societies that had not yet achieved full economic, political, and social modernization. Only Europeans, it was argued, possessed the expert scientific knowledge that could lead underdeveloped peoples to social progress. The latter were nevertheless granted citizenship in a French Union, albeit on more restricted terms than their metropolitan French counterparts.

And yet old habits died hard. In 1944 René Pleven, a leading colonial spokesman for the Free French, applauded “colonizing action, that is freeing people of the grand scourges which ravage primitive society, whether they be called superstition, ignorance, tyranny, corruption, exploitation or cruelty.” To colonize, he added, “is in the final analysis to project in space one’s civilization.” Throughout the postwar decades, republican references to “civilization” became scarcer, but the same contradictory images, if subtler in form, that had always structured the mission civilisatrice remained in force. An ethnocentric one construed colonized peoples as refractory to progress thanks to their tribal pasts (if not their skin color), while a universalistic one insisted that such pasts could and should be overcome to make the colonized more like the French.
